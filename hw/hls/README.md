# HLS

Sources and builds for HLS kernels. HLS kernels can be used for both:
- the Vitis flow (`make xo`) 
- the Vivado flow (`make csynth`)
The Makefile expects that each HLS kernel is defined in a single `.cpp` file under `src` and declared in a single `.hpp` file under `include`, with the same name as the kernel. If unit testing is supported for the kernel, a single file named kernel name + `_tb.cpp` can be added under `tb`.
